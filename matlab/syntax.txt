Syntax:
c = fast_atvo(A,x0)
c = fast_atvo(A,x0,opts)
[c,mod] = fast_atvo(__)
[c,mod,x] = fast_atvo(__)

Input arguments:
- A (required) is the weight matrix, it can be sparse or full, it must be
  square upper triangular with non-negative real elements (A will be
  symmetrized automatically leaving the diagonal unchanged, since the graph
  is assumed to be undirected);
- x0 (required) is the starting point of the algorithm, it must be a full
  column vector with length equal to the number of nodes;
- opts (optional) is a structure having (some of) the following fields:
  p_exp, which must be a numerical value greater than 1.
         It is the exponent parameter of the objective function.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to 1.4.
  ws_size, which must be a numerical value greater than or equal to 1.
         It is the maximum size of the working set in the optimization
         algorithm.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to
         max(10,min(1000,0.03*n)), where 'n' is the number of
         non-isolated nodes.
  out_it, which must be a numerical value greater than or equal to 1.
         It is the number of outer iterations for the globalization
         strategy.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to 1, i.e., the
         globalization strategy is not activated.
  lb, which must be a numerical value less than 0.
         It is the lower bound on the variables for the optimization
         problem.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to -1.
  ub, which must be a numerical value greater than 0.
         It is the upper bound on the variables for the optimization
         problem.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to 1.
  perc_at_bounds, which must be a numerical value between 0 and 1.
         It is the percentage of negative and positive variables that
         will be set to the lower and the upper bound in x0, respectively.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to 1, i.e., all
         non-zero variables in x0 will be set to the bounds.
  verbosity, which must be a numerical value between 0 and 2.
         It is the verbosity level, to print iteration details of the
         optimization algorithm.
         If not specified, by default it is equal to 0, i.e., there are
         no prints.

Output arguments:
- c is a 0-1 vector describing the two communities found by FAST-ATVO,
- mod is the community modularity found by FAST-ATVO,
- x is the solution found by the optimization algorithm.
